# Common Delete Translation Key Addition

## Overview

Added `common.delete` translation key to both Indonesian and English language files for consistent delete button labeling across the application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Indonesian Translation (id-ID/index.js)

```javascript
// Common
common: {
  yes: 'Ya',
  no: 'Tidak',
  ok: 'OK',
  cancel: 'Batal',
  delete: 'Hapus',          // ← Added
  confirm: 'Konfirmasi',
  warning: 'Peringatan',
  // ... rest of common keys
}
```

### 2. English Translation (en-US/index.js)

```javascript
// Common
common: {
  yes: 'Yes',
  no: 'No',
  ok: 'OK',
  cancel: 'Cancel',
  delete: 'Delete',         // ← Added
  confirm: 'Confirm',
  warning: 'Warning',
  // ... rest of common keys
}
```

## Usage Verification

### Components Already Using This Key:

1. **SimpleAvatarUpload.vue**:

   ```vue
   <q-btn
     flat
     :label="$t('common.delete')"
     color="negative"
     @click="deleteAvatar"
   />
   ```

2. **AvatarUpload.vue**:
   ```vue
   <q-btn
     flat
     :label="$t('common.delete')"
     color="negative"
     @click="deleteAvatar"
   />
   ```

## Benefits

### ✅ Consistency

- Standardized delete button text across all components
- Consistent translation approach using common keys
- Easier maintenance of delete-related UI text

### ✅ Internationalization

- **Indonesian**: "Hapus" - proper Indonesian translation for delete
- **English**: "Delete" - standard English term
- Ready for additional languages in the future

### ✅ Reusability

- Single key can be used anywhere delete functionality is needed
- Reduces duplication in translation files
- Follows established common key pattern

## Implementation Details

### Key Path

- **Translation Key**: `$t('common.delete')`
- **Indonesian Value**: `'Hapus'`
- **English Value**: `'Delete'`

### Usage Pattern

```vue
<!-- Standard delete button -->
<q-btn :label="$t('common.delete')" color="negative" />

<!-- Delete with icon -->
<q-btn :label="$t('common.delete')" icon="delete" color="negative" />

<!-- Flat delete button -->
<q-btn flat :label="$t('common.delete')" color="negative" />
```

### Placement in Translation Structure

Located in the `common` section alongside other universal UI elements:

- `common.yes` / `common.no`
- `common.ok` / `common.cancel`
- `common.delete` ← New addition
- `common.confirm`
- `common.warning` / `common.error` / `common.success`

## Testing Results

- ✅ No syntax errors in translation files
- ✅ Existing components continue to work correctly
- ✅ Translation key properly accessible via `$t('common.delete')`

## Future Usage

This key can now be used in any component that needs delete functionality:

- Data tables with delete actions
- Confirmation dialogs
- Context menus
- Toolbar delete buttons
- Form delete actions

## Files Modified

1. `/frontend/src/i18n/id-ID/index.js` - Added `delete: 'Hapus'`
2. `/frontend/src/i18n/en-US/index.js` - Added `delete: 'Delete'`

## Status

✅ **Complete** - Translation key successfully added and verified working in existing components.
